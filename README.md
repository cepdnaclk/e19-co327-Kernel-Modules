# Operating Systems Project 
In this project, I develop kernel modules in a Linux system.

## Part I - Introduction to Linux Kernel Modules (LKM)
1. Designed a kernel module that creates a "/proc" file named "/.proc/jiffies" that reports the current value of jiffies when the "/proc/jiffies" file is read, such as with the command "cat /proc/jiffies" and to remove "/proc/jiffies" when the module is removed.
